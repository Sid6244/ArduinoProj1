# ArduinoProj1
This project is based on microcontrollers and sensors.
We used ARDUINO UNO and ULTRASONIC SENSOR as the major components.
This was part of one of my open ended projects done for MICROPROCESSORS AND MICROCONTROLLERS LABORATORY in the 4th semester of my B-Tech.
The title of the project is:"Ultrasonic security system with sound and text alarm".
